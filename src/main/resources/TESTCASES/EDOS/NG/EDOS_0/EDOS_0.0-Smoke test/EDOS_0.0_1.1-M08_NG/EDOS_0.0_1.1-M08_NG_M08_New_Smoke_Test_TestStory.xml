The initial Laboratory Test Compendium build from Century Hospital Clinical Laboratory consist of a single Prothrombin Time panel ('PT +INR').  This compendium is delivered electronically to Dr. Nicholas Radon's practice EHR, as agreed to between Laboratory and Dr. Radon's Office and EHR Vendor.   The EHR will integrate the eDOS into its test directory and use it to allow Dr. Radon to place orders electronically to Century Hospital's Clinical Laboratory.   The initial laboratory test compendium is composed of three messages.&#13;
Century Hospital's LIS transmit the first message which provides information about the PT and INR observations.</Description>
