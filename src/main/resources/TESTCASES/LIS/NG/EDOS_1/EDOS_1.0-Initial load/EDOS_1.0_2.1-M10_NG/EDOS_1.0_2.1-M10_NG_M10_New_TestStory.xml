    <Description>The originator of the eDOS is the Century Hospital Clinical Laboratory located at 2070 Test Park, Los Angeles, CA, 90067, CLIA: 24D9871327 , phone number: (310) 461-3666.&#13;
The Sender is the  Century Hospital Clinical Laboratory LIS.&#13;
The Receiver is Dr. Radon's Office EHR.&#13;
&#13;
The initial Laboratory Test Compendium build from Century Hospital Clinical Laboratory is a subset of their Directory of Services.  It based upon the most commonly ordered lab tests by Dr. Radon.  This compendium is delivered electronically to Dr. Nicholas Radon's practice EHR, as agreed to between Laboratory and Dr. Radon's Office and EHR Vendor.   The EHR will integrate the eDOS into its test directory and use it to allow Dr. Radon to place orders electronically to Century Hospital's Clinical Laboratory.   The initial laboratory test compendium is composed of three messages.  After Century Hospital's LIS successfully transmits the first message which provides information about each individual observation, it sends the second message which provides information for each orderable battery or profile.</Description>
