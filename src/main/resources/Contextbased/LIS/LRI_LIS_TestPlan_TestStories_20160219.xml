Mr. William A. Jones is a 51 year old white male who presented with pain, swelling, and redness in several joints including his elbows, wrists, knees, and hips. In order to rule out rheumatoid arthritis, Dr. Nicholas Radon ordered an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or Sed Rate) blood test to be performed, specifying that the laboratory was to draw the blood specimen from the patient the same day.
