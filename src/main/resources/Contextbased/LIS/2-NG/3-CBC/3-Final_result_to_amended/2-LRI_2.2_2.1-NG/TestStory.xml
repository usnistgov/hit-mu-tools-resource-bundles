		<Description>The laboratory at Century Hospital, 2070 Test Park, Los Angeles, CA 90067 received a blood specimen from Dr. Radon's office on patient Willow C. Jones for a complete blood count (CBC) test.  The patient was identified in the system as a 14 year old white female.  The blood specimen was analyzed and the final result revealed high WBC, particularly Lymphocytes and Neutrophils as well as high hematocrit, MCV and MCH. The final test result report was generated by the LIS and transmitted to the patient's record in the ambulatory EHR used in Dr. Radon's office.

The following morning, Dr. Radon upon review of results noticed that the Willow's Date of birth was listed as 12/27/2001, but Willow is only 4 years old, not 14. Dr. Radon notified the lab to correct the Date of Birth to 12/27/2010. The lab reviewed the results and adjusts the normal ranges for the observations based on on the updated age from adult reference ranges to 4 year old and reissued the report as amended, leaving only the elevated WBC, with increased Neutrophils and a low hemoglobin as abnormal results.  The laboratory included a comment, stating, "The patient's DOB was corrected by request of the ordering provider. The normal ranges are based on age group and so were adjusted accordingly for most of these observations, which led to a change in interpretations of existing results. Please review all interpretations in detail."</Description>
