		<Description>
The Laboratory Test Compendium from Century Hospital Clinical Laboratory is a subset of their Directory of Services.  It is based upon the most commonly ordered lab tests by Dr. Radon.  This compendium is being used by Dr. Nicholas Radon's practice EHR-S to place orders electronically to Century Hospital's Clinical Laboratory.  Century Hospital has made changes to their test compendium:
- limited coverage information for the added Lipid Panel
- limited coverage information for the added Measured Low density lipoprotein cholesterol, serum (LDL) test
- limited coverage information for the deactivated Saint Luis Encephalitis IgG Antibody test and the Arbovirus Panel.
Century Hospital's LIS transmits the appropriate eDOS update message to update this information for limited coverage tests in Dr. Radon's EHR. </Description>
