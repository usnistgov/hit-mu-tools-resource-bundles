		<Description>
The Laboratory Test Compendium from Century Hospital Clinical Laboratory is a subset of their Directory of Services.  It is based upon the most commonly ordered lab tests by Dr. Radon.  This compendium is being used by Dr. Nicholas Radon's practice EHR-S to place orders electronically to Century Hospital's Clinical Laboratory.  Century Hospital has made changes to their test compendium:
- Added CPT codes for the Stool culture with susceptibility reflex
- Added CPT codes for the susceptibility panel
- Added CPT codes for the individually orderable stool culture
Century Hospital's LIS transmits the appropriate eDOS update messages with these changes to Dr. Radon's EHR.</Description>
