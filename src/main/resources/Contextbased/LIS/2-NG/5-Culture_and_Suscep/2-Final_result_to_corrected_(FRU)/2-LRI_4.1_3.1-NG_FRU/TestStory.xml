		<Description>Mr. William A. Jones is a 51 year old white male who presented with a complaint of diarrhea times 3 days. Dr. Nicholas Radon ordered a stool culture test to be performed. A stool specimen for the microbiology test was collected from the patient and sent to the clinical lab at Century Hospital, 2070 Test Park, Los Angeles, CA, 90067, for processing. The stool specimen was analyzed and preliminary result are sent 24 hours later, identifying E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella and Shigella flexneri.

Approximately 48 hours later the Final results, including susceptibility testing of Shigella flexneri are available. The final result report was generated by the LIS and transmitted to the patient's record in the ambulatory EHR used in Dr. Radon's office practice.

Five hours later the laboratorian realizes that the result in the susceptibility suite for Shigella Flexneri was wrong and corrects the report.</Description>
		<PreCondition>LRI_4.0_1.1-NG AND LRI_4.1_2.1-NG_FRU have been sent previously.</PreCondition>
		<PostCondition>No Post Condition.</PostCondition>
		<TestObjectives>Determine if the system can correctly create a valid Parent-Child message for a corrected Stool Culture/Susceptibility microbiology test report.
</TestObjectives>
		<Notes>This is a variation of a follow up report to LRI_4.1_2.1-NG_FRU
Check that the parent-child linkage is correctly implemented:
The second OBR has OBR-26 populated with the result that spawned the respective susceptibility testing, e.g. the second group, first sequence of the Stool culture ( Salmonella I, group O:4)
The third OBR has OBR-26 populated with the result that spawned the respective susceptibility testing, e.g. the third group, first sequence Stool culture (Shigella flexneri). 
In both cases the OBR-29 references the Placer and Filler Order Number of the Stool culture OBR.
In the third order group a corrected result is sent.</Notes>
		<Comments>This is a variation of a follow up report to LRI_4.1_2.1-NG_FRU
This test case is evaluating correct use of the status codes in OBR-25 and OBX-11.
Special case test aspects include ensuring that the system can correctly populate the data elements for linking parent/child results in accordance with the requirements specified in the implementation guide for the FRN and FRU profiles.</Comments>
