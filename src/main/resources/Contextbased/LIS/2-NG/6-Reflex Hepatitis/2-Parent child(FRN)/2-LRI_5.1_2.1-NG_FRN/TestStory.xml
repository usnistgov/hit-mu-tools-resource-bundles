		<Description>A patient is hospitalized for substance abuse. The physician orders a hepatitis panel through the hospital's EHR system to test for Hepatitis A, B and C antibodies/antigens. The serum specimen is collected the same day at in the morning and submitted to the hospital lab for testing via their LIS right after it was drawn. A few hours later the patient's test results are as follows:
 (1)Hepatitis A IgM antibodies (IgM anti-HAV) "Negative"
 (2)Hepatitis A antibodies (anti-HAV) "Negative"
 (3)Hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBVc) "Negative"
 (4)Hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBVc) quantitative 0.40 IU/mL (reference range: &lt;0.50 IU/mL)
 (5)Hepatitis B virus e antibodies (anti-HBVe) "Negative"
 (6)Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBVsAg) "Negative"
 (7)Hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBVs) "Negative"
 (8)Hepatitis C antibody screen (anti-HCV) "Positive"
 (9)Hepatitis C antibodies Signal to Cut-off Ratio 10.8 s/co (reference range: 0.0-0.9 s/co)

Per CDC recommendations, a confirmatory Hepatitis C RNA PCR test is performed because of the positive Anti-HCV findings. The next day, the Hepatitis C RNA PCR test results confirm the patient is positive for hepatitis, with a value of 761120 IU/ml (reference range: &lt; 43). The Hepatitis C results trigger an Abnormal Flag or "High", as well as the comment:
 "Negative: &lt; 0.8, Indeterminate 0.8 - 0.9, Positive: &gt; 0.9. In order to reduce the incidence of a false positive result, the CDC recommends that all s/co ratios between 1.0 and 10.9 be confirmed with additional Verification or PCR testing."
The final report is completed on that day and sent to the ordering provider.</Description>
		<PreCondition>LRI_5.1_1.1-NG_FRN  has been previously sent.</PreCondition>
		<PostCondition>No Post Condition.</PostCondition>
		<TestObjectives>Demonstrate the capability to create a valid Parent-Child message for a Hepatitis-Reflex lab result message.
Tests support for multiple comments for one test result.</TestObjectives>
		<Comments>This is the reflex message and  this test case is evaluating correct use of the status codes in OBR-25 and OBX-11.
Special case test aspects include ensuring that the system can correctly populate the data elements for linking parent/child results in accordance with the requirements specified in the implementation guide for the FRN and FRU profiles.</Comments>
