		<Description>Ms. Janet Anderson is a 26 year old white female who presented with fever of unknown origin and generalized joint pain. In order to rule out infection and autoimmune disease, Dr. Nicholas Radon ordered an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or Sed Rate) blood test to be performed. A blood specimen for the ESR test was collected from the patient and sent to the clinical lab for processing. The analysis could not be performed because the specimen arrived clotted. No result value could be obtained. A Specimen Rejection message for this lab test was generated by the LIS and transmitted to the patient's record in the ambulatory EHR used in Dr. Radon's office practice.</Description>
		<PreCondition>No Pre-condition.</PreCondition>

		<TestObjectives>Determine if a valid  Rejected Specimen message for an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) blood test can be created. 
Special case test aspects include ensuring that the system can populate the data elements required for a specimen rejection test message.</TestObjectives>
		<Notes>Note that data elements SPM-21 and SPM-24 is provided in the test data. These elements are optional for the sender and required-but maybe empty for the receiver. These elements are not subject to conformance testing for this test case (sender).</Notes>
