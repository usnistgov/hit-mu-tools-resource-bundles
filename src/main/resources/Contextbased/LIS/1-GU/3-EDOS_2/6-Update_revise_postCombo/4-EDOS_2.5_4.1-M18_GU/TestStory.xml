		<Description>
The Laboratory Test Compendium from Century Hospital Clinical Laboratory is a subset of their Directory of Services.  It is based upon the most commonly ordered lab tests by Dr. Radon.  This compendium is being used by Dr. Nicholas Radon's practice EHR to place orders electronically to Century Hospital's Clinical Laboratory.  Century Hospital's has revised the Lipid panel and made its components orderable.  Century Hospital's LIS transmits the appropriate eDOS update message to update this information for limited coverage tests in Dr. Radon's EHR. </Description>
