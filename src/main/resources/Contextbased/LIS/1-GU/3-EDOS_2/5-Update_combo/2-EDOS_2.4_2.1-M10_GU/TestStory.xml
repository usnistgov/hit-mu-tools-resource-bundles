		<Description>
The Laboratory Test Compendium from Century Hospital Clinical Laboratory is a subset of their Directory of Services.  It is based upon the most commonly ordered lab tests by Dr. Radon.    This compendium is being used by Dr. Nicholas Radon's practice EHR-S to place orders electronically to Century Hospital's Clinical Laboratory.  Century Hospital has made the following changes to their test compendium:
- Added a Lipid Panel and its related components
- Deactivated the Arbovirus Panel
- Revised the Complete Metabolic Panel (CMP) adding a Gamma Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) test to the panel
Century Hospital's LIS transmits the appropriate eDOS update messages with these changes to Dr. Radon's EHR.</Description>
