		<Description>Mr. William A. Jones is a 51 year old white male who presented with a history of fever, fatigue, and shortness of breath on exertion. Dr. Nicholas Radon ordered a complete blood count (CBC) test to be performed. A blood specimen for the CBC test was collected from the patient and sent to the clinical lab at Century Hospital, 2070 Test Park, Los Angeles, CA, 90067, for processing.
