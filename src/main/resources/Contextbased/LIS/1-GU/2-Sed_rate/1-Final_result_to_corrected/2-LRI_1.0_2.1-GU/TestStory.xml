		<Description>Based on LRI_1.0_Sed_Rate and LRI_1.1_Sed_Rate:
Mr. William A. Jones is a 51 year old white male who presented with pain, swelling, and redness in several joints including his elbows, wrists, knees, and hips. In order to rule out rheumatoid arthritis, Dr. Nicholas Radon ordered an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or Sed Rate) blood test to be performed, specifying that the laboratory was to draw the blood specimen from the patient the same day. The final result of this test was 10 mm/hr, a normal value with the normal reference range being 0-17 mm/hr. The final result report for this lab test was generated by the LIS and transmitted to the patient's record in the ambulatory EHR used in Dr. Radon's office practice later that same day.

The ESR test instrument was recalibrated and the ESR specimen was re-analyzed. After the recalibration and re-analysis, the result value for Mr. Jones' ESR test changed from 10 mm/hr to 20 mm/hr. A Corrected result report with a result value of 20 mm/hr and an abnormal flag of "H" was generated by the LIS and transmitted to the patient's record in the ambulatory EHR used in Dr. Radon's office practice.</Description>
		<PreCondition>LRI_1.0_1.1-GU/LRI_1.0_1.1-NG have been previously sent which includes specific content in which the data type for OBX.2 is NM, the result is "10" (OBX.5), the abnormal flag is "N" (OBX.8), and the observation results status is "F" (OBX.11).</PreCondition>
		<PostCondition>No Post Condition.</PostCondition>
		<TestObjectives>Demonstrate the ability to message corrected results  based on previous results.
Specific test points include the use of the NM data type for OBX.2, the value of "20" for results (OBX.5), the value of "H" for abnormal flags (OBX.8), and the observation results status is "C" (OBX.11).</TestObjectives>
		<Notes>Run LRI_1.0_1.1-GU_Sed_Rate_Final test case prior to this test case. Note that this test case is explicitly requiring the use of the NM data type for OBX-2 (even though the SN data type is equally correct). 
Note that data element SPM-24 is provided in the test data. This element is optional for the sender and required-but maybe empty for the receiver. This element is not subject to conformance testing for this test case (sender).</Notes>
		<Comments>This test case is evaluating the correct use of the status codes in OBR-25 and OBX-11.</Comments>
