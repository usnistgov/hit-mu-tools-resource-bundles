		<Description>Mrs. Delores Lopez is a 30 year old Hispanic female who presents to Dr. Radon's clinic for a routine gynecological examination. A pap smear sample is collected after confirming with Ms. Lopez that her last menstrual period was two weeks ago.  A pap smear is ordered from Century Hospital's clinical lab through the Clinic's EHR and the specimen is sent to the lab for testing along with the response to the ask on order (AOE) question "Date of last menstrual period". Century Hospital's clinical lab forwarded this order to Pacific Anatomic Pathology Services which performed the test. 
The final results were sent from Century Hospital's clinical lab's LIS to the Provider's EHR.</Description>
