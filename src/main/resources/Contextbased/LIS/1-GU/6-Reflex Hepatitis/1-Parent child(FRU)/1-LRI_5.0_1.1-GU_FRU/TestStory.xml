 (2)Hepatitis A antibodies (anti-HAV) "Negative"
 (3)Hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBVc) "Negative"
 (4)Hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBVc) quantitative 0.40 IU/mL (reference range: &lt;0.50 IU/mL)
 (5)Hepatitis B virus e antibodies (anti-HBVe) "Negative"
 (6)Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBVsAg) "Negative"

 (8)Hepatitis C antibody screen (anti-HCV) "Positive"
 (9)Hepatitis C antibodies Signal to Cut-off Ratio 10.8 s/co (reference range: 0.0-0.9 s/co)
The hospital LIS sends and LRI message containing these results to the EHR-S. </Description>
