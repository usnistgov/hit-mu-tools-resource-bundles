  "teststorydesc" : "Syndromic surveillance is public health surveillance that emphasizes the use of near \"real-time\" health data and statistical tools for disease or hazardous event detection, situation awareness for mass gatherings and public health emergencies, and ad hoc and population health trend analyses. For syndromic surveillance purposes, required data on all clinical encounters must be sent to the jurisdictional public health agency within 24 hours of any given encounter, and in accordance with local or state laws and practices.\r\n<br>\r\nThe Child_Influenza Test Case provides an example of a clinical encounter that could take place in either an urgent care or emergency clinical setting. It is therefore applicable to EHR technology used in some ambulatory settings. This test case also provides an example where the facility sending the syndromic surveillance message is different than the facility where the patient received care.\r\n<br>\r\nIn this test case, an infant is seen at an urgent care center for fever, cough, and earache. Diagnostic tests show that he has influenza and stenosis of the external ear canal. He is discharged to home with treatment instructions and a prescription. Syndromic surveillance data about the visit are transmitted to the local health department.\r\n<br>\r\nThis test case involves 2 steps: a registration message (ADT^A04) followed by a discharge message (ADT^A03).",
