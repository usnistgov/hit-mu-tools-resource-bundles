		<Description>Mr. William A. Jones is a 51 year old white male who presented with a complaint of diarrhea times 3 days. Dr. Nicholas Radon ordered a stool culture test to be performed. A stool specimen for the microbiology test was collected from the patient and sent to the clinical lab at Century Hospital, 2070 Test Park, Los Angeles, CA, 90067, for processing.  The stool specimen was analyzed and preliminary result are sent 24 hours later, identifying E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella and Shigella flexneri.

Approximately 48 hours later the Final results, including susceptibility testing of Shigella flexneri are available. The final result report was generated by the LIS and transmitted to the patient's record in the ambulatory EHR used in Dr. Radon's office practice.</Description>
		<PreCondition>Patient information is pre-loaded in the EHR-S.
and Test case LRI_4.0_1.1-NG message has been received and incorporated.</PreCondition>
		<PostCondition>The test message information received by the EHR-S has been incorporated with the patient's record.</PostCondition>
		<TestObjectives>Determine if the system can correctly import and incorporate a valid Parent-Child message for a final Stool Culture/Susceptibility microbiology test report.
</TestObjectives>
		<Notes>Run LRI_4.0_1.1-NG prior to this test case. This test case requires display verification only.
Concentrate on the following areas:
Result Report Status (OBR-25) changed from P to F
3 different results (OBX-5) and their interpretations (OBX-8) for the same test are properly displayed; Result Status (OBX-11) changed from P to F
Check that the parent-child linkage is correctly implemented:
The susceptibility test results are linked to the correct result that spawned the respective susceptibility testing, e.g. once for "Salmonella I, group O:4" and once for "Shigella flexneri", both results of the same parent order (Stool culture).</Notes>
		<Comments>This test case is evaluating the proper use of OBR-22 to establish chronological order of reports and correct use of the status codes in OBR-25 and OBX-11.
Special case test aspects include ensuring that the system can correctly process the data elements for linking parent/child results in accordance with the requirements specified in the implementation guide for the FRN and FRU profiles.
