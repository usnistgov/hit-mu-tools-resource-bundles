		<Description>The laboratory at Century Hospital, 2070 Test Park, Los Angeles, CA 90067 received a blood specimen from Dr. Radon's office on patient Willow A. Jones for a complete blood count (CBC) test.  The patient was identified in the system as a 14 year old white female.  The blood specimen was analyzed and the final result revealed critically high WBC of 32,000/uL.   Dr. Radon was notified of the critical result by phone and the laboratory included the following comment in the report , "Critically high WBC reported to Dr. Radon by phone the day of the report." The final test result report was generated by the LIS and transmitted to the patient's record in the ambulatory EHR used in Dr. Radon's office.

The following morning, Dr. Radon upon review of results noticed several anomalies with the results and notified the lab. The lab traced the issue back to mislabeled specimens and reissued the report as corrected, indicating that the results were reported on the wrong patient.  The laboratory included a comment, stating, "All results previously reported for this patient were reported in error; they do not apply to this patient."</Description>
