		<Description>Mr. William A. Jones is a 51 year old white male who presented for a cardiology exam. Dr. Nicholas Radon ordered a lipid panel test to be performed to check for hyperlipidemia. A blood specimen for the lipid panel test was collected from the patient and sent to the clinical lab at Century Hospital, 2070 Test Park, Los Angeles, CA, 90067, for processing. The laboratory director at this hospital is Dr. Phil J. Knowsalot, III. The blood specimen was analyzed, and the final result of the lipid panel test showed that all components were within the normal range. The final result report for this lab test was generated by the LIS and transmitted to the patient's record in the ambulatory EHR used in Dr. Radon's office practice. A copy of the test result report was sent to Dr. Pafford M. Hamlin, Sr.

A duplicate report of the report is sent shortly after the first.</Description>
