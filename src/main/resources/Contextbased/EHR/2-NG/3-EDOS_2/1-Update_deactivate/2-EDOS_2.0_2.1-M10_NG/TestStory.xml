		<Description>
The Laboratory Test Compendium from Century Hospital Clinical Laboratory is a subset of their Directory of Services.  It based upon the most commonly ordered lab tests.  This compendium is being used by Dr. Nicholas Radon's practice EHR-S  to place orders electronically to Century Hospital's Clinical Laboratory.   Century Hospital Laboratory no longer offers a particular General Health Profile (GHP).   Century Hospital's LIS transmits the appropriate eDOS update message to deactivate this GHP panel in Dr. Radon's EHR. </Description>
