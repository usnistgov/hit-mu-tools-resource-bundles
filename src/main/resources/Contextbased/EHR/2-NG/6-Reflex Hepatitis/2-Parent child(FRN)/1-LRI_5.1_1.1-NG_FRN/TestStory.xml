		<Description>A patient is hospitalized for substance abuse. The physician orders a hepatitis panel through the hospital's EHR system to test for Hepatitis A, B and C antibodies/antigens. The serum specimen is collected the same day at in the morning and submitted to the hospital lab for testing via their LIS right after it was drawn. A few hours later the patient's test results are as follows:
 (1)Hepatitis A IgM antibodies (IgM anti-HAV) "Negative"
 (2)Hepatitis A antibodies (anti-HAV) "Negative"
 (3)Hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBVc) "Negative"
 (4)Hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBVc) quantitative 0.40 IU/mL (reference range: &lt;0.50 IU/mL)
 (5)Hepatitis B virus e antibodies (anti-HBVe) "Negative"
 (6)Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBVsAg) "Negative"
 (7)Hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBVs) "Negative"
 (8)Hepatitis C antibody screen (anti-HCV) "Positive"
 (9)Hepatitis C antibodies Signal to Cut-off Ratio 10.8 s/co (reference range: 0.0-0.9 s/co)
The hospital LIS sends an LRI message containing these results to the EHR-S. </Description>
		<PreCondition>Patient information is pre-loaded in the EHR-S.
No other Pre-Condition.</PreCondition>
		<PostCondition>The test message information received by the EHR-S has been incorporated with the patient's record.</PostCondition>
		<TestObjectives>Demonstrate the capability to import and incorporate a typically populated Hepatitis Panel lab result message.
Tests support for multiple comments for one test result.</TestObjectives>
		<Notes>For display verification focus on these areas:
Proper display of the results (OBX-5) with structured numeric format (#4 and 9) with interpretations (OBX-8) 
Comments for result of the lab result identified as "Hepatitis C virus Ab Signal/Cutoff in Serum or Plasma by Immunoassay" is properly grouped with its result.
Results for the Reflex test are properly associated with the result that spawned its creation, which is the detection of Hepatitis C virus Antibody in Serum, as part of the Hepatitis A B C Panel screen.
