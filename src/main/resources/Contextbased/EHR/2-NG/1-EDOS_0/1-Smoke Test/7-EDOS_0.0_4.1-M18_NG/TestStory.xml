		<Description>
The initial Laboratory Test Compendium built by Century Hospital Clinical Laboratory consists of a single Prothrombin Time panel (PT +INR).  This compendium is delivered electronically to Dr. Nicholas Radon's practice EHR, as agreed to between Laboratory and Dr. Radon's Office and EHR-S Vendor.   The EHR-S will integrate the eDOS into its test directory and use it to allow Dr. Radon to place orders electronically to Century Hospital's Clinical Laboratory.   The initial laboratory test compendium is composed of four messages.
After Century Hospital's LIS transmits the first three messages with the test, panel and charge information, it sends the fourth message, which provides information about the tests that are covered by Medicare insurance.</Description>
		<PreCondition>EDOS_0.0_1.1-M08_New_SmokeTest

EDOS_0.0_2.1-M10_New_SmokeTest

		<Comments>This is the initial "smoke testing" to reveal simple failures severe enough to preclude further testing.  Initial upload of a list of approved coverage for a panel in a new compendium. 
Since this is a replace message, all data in this message will replace information from a previous eDOS M18 message.</Comments>
