		<Description>
The initial Laboratory Test Compendium built by Century Hospital Clinical Laboratory consists of a single Prothrombin Time panel (PT +INR).  This compendium is delivered electronically to Dr. Nicholas Radon's practice EHR, as agreed to between Laboratory and Dr. Radon's Office and EHR-S Vendor.   The EHR-S will integrate the eDOS into its test directory and use it to allow Dr. Radon to place orders electronically to Century Hospital's Clinical Laboratory.   The initial laboratory test compendium is composed of four messages.
After Century Hospital's LIS transmits the first and second messages which provides information about the PT and INR observations and then orderable PT + INR panel,  it sends the third message which provides information about CPT procedure codes for the PT + INR panel.</Description>
		<PreCondition>EDOS_0.0_1.1-M08_New_SmokeTest
and
EDOS_0.0_2.1-M10_New_SmokeTest
have been completed.</PreCondition>
		<PostCondition>eDOS M08, M10 and M04 data elements are incorporated appropriately into the EHR-S.</PostCondition>
		<TestObjectives>Demonstrate capability to support a minimal M04 initial load message.
Demonstrate capability to support a single occurrence of all required ("R") elements in the MSH segment.
Demonstrate capability to support a single occurrence of all required ("R") elements in the MFI segment.
Demonstrate capability to support a single occurrence of all required ("R") elements in the MFE segment.
Demonstrate capability to support a single occurrence of all required ("R") elements in the CDM segment.</TestObjectives>
		<Comments>This is the initial "smoke testing" to reveal simple failures severe enough to preclude further testing.  Initial upload of a charge code (CPT code) for a panel for a new compendium. 
Since this is a replace message, all data in this message will replace information from a previous eDOS M04 message.</Comments>
