		<Description>
The initial Laboratory Test Compendium built by Century Hospital Clinical Laboratory consists of a single Prothrombin Time panel (PT +INR).  This compendium is delivered electronically to Dr. Nicholas Radon's practice EHR, as agreed to between Laboratory and Dr. Radon's Office and EHR-S Vendor.   The EHR-S will integrate the eDOS into its test directory and use it to allow Dr. Radon to place orders electronically to Century Hospital's Clinical Laboratory.   The initial laboratory test compendium is composed of five messages.
After Century Hospital's LIS transmits the first three messages with the test, panel and charge information, and the fourth message, which provides information about the tests that are covered by several insurance companies, it send the last message in the initial upload, which provides information about the tests that are not covered under specific insurance company agreements.</Description>
