		<Description>
The Laboratory Test Compendium from Century Hospital Clinical Laboratory is a subset of their Directory of Services.  It is based upon the most commonly ordered lab tests by Dr. Radon.  This compendium is being used by Dr. Nicholas Radon's practice EHR-S  to place orders electronically to Century Hospital's Clinical Laboratory.  Century Hospital Laboratory had decided to no longer offer the sedimentation rate test.
