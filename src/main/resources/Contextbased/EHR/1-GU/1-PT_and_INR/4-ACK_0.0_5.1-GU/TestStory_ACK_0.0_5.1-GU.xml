		<Description>Century Hospital's LIS transmits an accept acknowledgement message to Dr Radon's EHR-S which indicates the Application Acknowledgement message has been successfully received.</Description>
		<PreCondition>Patient information is pre-loaded in the EHR-S.
No other Pre-Condition.</PreCondition>
		<PostCondition>No Post-Condition.</PostCondition>
		<TestObjectives>Minimally populated message.
Demonstrate ability to import and incorporate all required data elements for the accept acknowledgement test case:
Minimally populated MSH Segment - Demonstrate the capability to support the minimally required data elements in the MSH segment.
Minimally populated MSA Segment - Demonstrate the capability to support the minimally required data elements in the MSA segment.</TestObjectives>
		<Notes>To support real-time dynamic testing, the Tester at their discretion, may selectively modify result acknowledgement data prior to importing the test message into the EHR technology.</Notes>
		<Comments>This is the initial "smoke testing" to reveal simple failures of the acknowledgment message severe enough to preclude further testing.</Comments>
