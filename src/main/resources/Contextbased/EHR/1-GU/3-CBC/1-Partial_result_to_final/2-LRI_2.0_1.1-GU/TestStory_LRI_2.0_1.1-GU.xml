		<Description>Mr. William A. Jones is a 51 year old white male who presented with a history of fever, fatigue, and shortness of breath on exertion. Dr. Nicholas Radon ordered a complete blood count (CBC) test to be performed. A blood specimen for the CBC test was collected from the patient and sent to the clinical lab at Century Hospital, 2070 Test Park, Los Angeles, CA, 90067, for processing. The laboratory director at this hospital is Dr. Phil J. Knowsalot, III. The blood specimen was analyzed, and before all of the results are available a partial report is generated by the LIS and transmitted to the patient's record in the ambulatory EHR used in Dr. Radon's office practice. A copy of the test result report was sent to  Dr. Hamlin Pafford.

The next day the all results of the CBC test are available and a final report is generated by the LIS and transmitted to the patient's record in the ambulatory EHR used in Dr. Radon's office practice. A copy of the test result report was sent to Dr. Hamlin Pafford.</Description>
