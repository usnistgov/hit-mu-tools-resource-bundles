		<Description>Ms. Janet Anderson is a 26 year old white female who presented with fever of unknown origin and generalized joint pain. In order to rule out infection and autoimmune disease, Dr. Nicholas Radon ordered an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or Sed Rate) blood test to be performed. A blood specimen for the ESR test was collected from the patient and sent to the clinical lab for processing. The analysis could not be performed because the specimen arrived clotted. No result value could be obtained. A Specimen Rejection message for this lab test was generated by the LIS and transmitted to the patient's record in the ambulatory EHR used in Dr. Radon's office practice.</Description>
		<PreCondition>Patient information is pre-loaded in the EHR-S.
No other Pre-Condition.</PreCondition>
		<PostCondition>The test message information received by the EHR-S has been incorporated with the patient's record.</PostCondition>
		<TestObjectives>Demonstrate the capability of the EHR-S to import and incorporate a valid Rejected Specimen message.</TestObjectives>
		<Notes>Since the specimen was rejected there is no lab result in the Juror Document; there is however specimen reject information that needs to be displayed.
This test case requires display verification only. 
Concentrate on the following areas: 
Result Report Status (OBR-25) is X 
Information about the specimen condition (SPM-24) and reject reason (SPM-21)
A result value (OBX-5) showing that the test could not be performed with attached comment (NTE after OBX) as explanation.</Notes>
		<Comments>This test case tests handling of specimen rejection.</Comments>
