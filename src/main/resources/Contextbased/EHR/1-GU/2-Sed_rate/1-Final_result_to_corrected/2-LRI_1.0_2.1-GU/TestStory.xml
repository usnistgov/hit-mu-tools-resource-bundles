		<Description>Based on LRI_1.0_Sed_Rate and LRI_1.1_Sed_Rate:
Mr. William A. Jones is a 51 year old white male who presented with pain, swelling, and redness in several joints including his elbows, wrists, knees, and hips. In order to rule out rheumatoid arthritis, Dr. Nicholas Radon ordered an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or Sed Rate) blood test to be performed, specifying that the laboratory was to draw the blood specimen from the patient the same day. The final result of this test was 10 mm/hr, a normal value with the normal reference range being 0-17 mm/hr. The final result report for this lab test was generated by the LIS and transmitted to the patient's record in the ambulatory EHR used in Dr. Radon's office practice later that same day.

The ESR test instrument was recalibrated and the ESR specimen was re-analyzed. After the recalibration and re-analysis, the result value for Mr. Jones' ESR test changed from 10 mm/hr to 20 mm/hr. A Corrected result report with a result value of 20 mm/hr and an abnormal flag of "H" was generated by the LIS and transmitted to the patient's record in the ambulatory EHR used in Dr. Radon's office practice.</Description>
		<PreCondition>Patient information is pre-loaded in the EHR-S.
and LRI_1.0_1.1-GU has been previously received by the EHR-S and incorporated with the patient's record.</PreCondition>
		<PostCondition>The test message information received by the EHR-S has been incorporated with the patient's record.</PostCondition>
		<TestObjectives>Demonstrate the ability to update the patient record based on corrected results.</TestObjectives>
		<Notes>Run LRI_1.0-GU_Sed_Rate_Final test case prior to this test case. This test case requires display verification only.
Concentrate on the following areas: 
Result Report Status â€“ now C instead of F (OBR-25)
Result date/time is later than before (OBR-22)
Result for Sed Rate changed from 10 to 20 (OBX-5), which changed the interpretation (OBX-8) from N to H and result status (OBX-11) is C
An additional comment (NTE after OBX) is displayed at the result level, indicating: "Specimen re-analyzed per request of ordering provider."</Notes>
		<Comments>This test case is evaluating the proper use of OBR-22 to establish chronological order of reports and correct use of the status codes in OBR-25 and OBX-11 for a corrected result.</Comments>
