		<Description>Mr. William A. Jones is a 51 year old white male who presented with pain, swelling, and redness in several joints including his elbows, wrists, knees, and hips. In order to screen for rheumatoid diseases, Dr. Nicholas Radon ordered an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or Sed Rate) blood test using the Good Health Clinic's EHR system,  specifying that the laboratory's patient service center was to draw the blood specimen from the patient later that same day.  Dr Radon also requests that the results be CC'd to Dr Pafford M. Hamlin Sr, a specialist to which he is referring Mr. Jones as well as Dr. Daniel Davison who is Mr. Jones' regular doctor.
The laboratory performs the requested test and the final result was 10 mm/hr, a normal value with the normal reference range being 0-17 mm/hr. The final result report for this lab test was generated by the LIS and transmitted to the patient's record in the Good health Clinic's EHR system used in Dr. Radon's office practice on the same day.</Description>
