A clerical assistant\r\nregisters the patient for admission. He records the patient's name, date of\r\nbirth, race, ethnicity, residence, and insurance information. At 7:30 AM the\r\npatient is escorted to a pre-operation room where a nurse captures the\r\npatient's health history, which includes chest pain, inputs the reason for\r\nvisit as I25.110 (Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with unstable angina pectoris), and inputs angina pectoris for the\r\npatient's diagnosis (I20.9).The\r\npatient is then prepared for the procedure, and at 8:30 AM the patient has the\r\nprocedure. It occurs without incident, and the patient goes to post-operation\r\nrecovery unit to wake from anesthesia, and receive a post-op examination. At\r\n2:00 PM the patient, who is in good condition, is transported to a cardiac unit\r\nfor overnight observation.Mountainview General Hospital reports inpatient syndromic\r\nsurveillance data to the state health department (SHD) for all new patient\r\nadmissions once per day. At 1:00 AM on August 18, 2015, the hospital's\r\nelectronic health record module for syndromic surveillance data assembles and\r\ntransmits an ADT^A01 Admission message about this encounter to SHD.</p>",
