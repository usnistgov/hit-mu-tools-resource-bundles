At 7:30 AM the patient is\r\nescorted to a pre-operation room where a nurse captures the patient's health\r\nhistory, which includes chest pain, inputs the reason for visit as z95.5, and inputs\r\nmultiple diagnoses for the patient (Primary I25.0, secondary I20.9, and\r\ntertiary R07.4). The patient is then prepared for the procedure, and at 8:30 AM\r\nthe patient has the procedure. It occurs without incident, and the patient goes\r\nto post-operation recovery unit to wake from anesthesia, and receive a post-op\r\nexamination.
