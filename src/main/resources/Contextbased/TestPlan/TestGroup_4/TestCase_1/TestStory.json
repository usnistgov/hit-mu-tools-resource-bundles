  "teststorydesc" : "Syndromic surveillance is public health surveillance that emphasizes the use of near \"real-time\" health data and statistical tools for disease or hazardous event detection, situation awareness for mass gatherings and public health emergencies, and ad hoc and population health trend analyses. For syndromic surveillance purposes, required data on all clinical encounters must be sent to the jurisdictional public health agency within 24 hours of the any given encounter, and in accordance with local or state laws and practices.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe IP Visit-Cardiac Surgery Test Case provides an example of an inpatient surgical visit for a patient with multiple diagnoses. In this scenario, syndromic surveillance data are sent to a state public health agency in accordance with guidelines recommended by the International Society for Disease Surveillance (i.e., once following admission and once following discharge).\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn this test case, a middle aged man is admitted for a pre-scheduled surgical removal of a coronary artery obstruction and insertion of stents, spends one night in the hospital for observation, and is discharged home.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThis test case involves 2 steps: an admission message (ADT^A01); and a discharge message (ADT^A03).",
