  "teststorydesc" : "Syndromic surveillance is public health surveillance that emphasizes the use of near \"real-time\" health data and statistical tools for disease or hazardous event detection, situation awareness for mass gatherings and public health emergencies, and ad hoc and population health trend analyses. For syndromic surveillance purposes, required data on all clinical encounters must be sent to the jurisdictional public health agency within 24 hours of any given encounter, and in accordance with local or state laws and practices. <div><br>\r\nThe ED Visit Test Case provides an example of an ED visit where the patient's demographic information is unavailable at registration, admit/encounter reason is captured as a coded value using an ICD-10 CM code, a working diagnosis and a final diagnosis are captured using ICD-10 CM codes, and the patient dies. </div><div><br>\r\nIn this test case, an unconscious, unknown female patient is brought to an emergency department by ambulance after she sustained critical head and neck injuries due to a collision with a bus while she was riding a bicycle. She is placed on a ventilator, diagnosed as having severe head trauma, and expires from her injuries. Syndromic surveillance data about the visit are transmitted to the state health department.\r\n<br>\r\nThis test case involves 3 steps: a registration message (ADT^A04), an update message (ADT^A08), and a discharge message (ADT^A03).</div>",
