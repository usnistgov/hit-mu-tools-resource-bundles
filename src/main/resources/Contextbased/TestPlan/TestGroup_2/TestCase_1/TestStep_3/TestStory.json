The working diagnoses (ICD-10-CM S02.112A and S06.9X3A) are resolved/inactivated, and the final diagnoses are  S06.0X8A (Concussion with LOC of any duration with death due to other cause prior to regaining consciousness) and S02.112A (Type III occipital condyle fracture, initial encounter for closed fracture). Western Regional Medical Center reports syndromic surveillance data to the state health department (SHD). At 6:00 PM on July 17, 2012 the hospital's electronic health record module for syndromic surveillance data assembles and transmits an ADT^A03 Discharge message about this encounter to SHD.",
  "comments" : "This Test Case provides an example of an ED visit where the patient's demographic information is unavailable at registration, admit/encounter reason is captured as a coded value using an ICD-10 CM code, two working diagnoses and a final diagnosis are captured using ICD-10 CM codes, and the patient dies. The dates and times in this test case illustrate the sequence of clinical and messaging events. Since the exact dates and times are not reproducible when modeling the test case with a Health IT Module, only date and time format will be validated within tester submitted test data. ICD-10 CM diagnosis codes are acceptable with or without decimals.",

An ICD-10 CM code is used for coding the final diagnosis. The Tester may ignore errors generated by the Test Tool related to incorrect code when the ICD-10 CM code used in the message is determined to be a valid code.<div><br></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">Visit Number ID (PV1-19.1) must be populated with the same value for all messages included in this Test Case to reflect the requirement in real-world installations.</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">Test Tool does not automatically test for this requirement, so Testers must manually inspect the messages to verify that PV1-19.1 is the same for all Test Step messages for a given Test Case.</span></div>"
