The tests indicate that the infant has influenza and pneumonia. The patient`s mother is provided with treatment information and prescriptions for her infant son. The working diagnosis (ICD-9 CM 487.1) is resolved/inactivated, and at 5 PM the patient is discharged home with a final diagnosis of influenza with pneumonia. Big City Children&#39;s Urgent Care is an outpatient facility operated by Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Big City that routinely sends electronic syndromic surveillance data to the Big City Health Department (BCHD) in accordance with a city regulation. At 6:00 PM on February 20, 2010, the facility`s electronic health record module for syndromic surveillance data assembles and transmits a Discharge ADT message about this patient encounter to BCHD.</p>\r\n",

It is therefore applicable to EHR technology used in some ambulatory settings. Dates and times are provided in this test scenario to illustrate the sequence of clinical and messaging events. Since the exact dates and times are not reproducible when modeling the test scenario with EHR technology, only date and time format will be validated within tester submitted test data.</p>\r\n",
