The working diagnoses (ICD-9 CM 487.1 and 380.53) are resolved/inactivated,\r\nand at 5 PM the patient is discharged home with final diagnoses of influenza\r\nand stenosis of external ear canal due to inflammation. Big City Children's\r\nUrgent Care is an outpatient facility operated by Children's Hospital of Big\r\nCity that routinely sends electronic syndromic surveillance data to the Big\r\nCity Health Department (BCHD) in accordance with a city regulation. At 6:00 PM\r\non February 20, 2010, the facility`s electronic health record module for\r\nsyndromic surveillance data assembles and transmits a Discharge ADT message\r\nabout this patient encounter to BCHD.</span></p>\r\n",
