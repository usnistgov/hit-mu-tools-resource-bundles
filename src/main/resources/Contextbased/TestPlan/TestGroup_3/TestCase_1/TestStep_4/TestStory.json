  "comments" : "This Test Case provides an example of an ED visit for which the patient's chief complaint is captured as free-text, working diagnosis and final diagnosis are captured with SNOMED CT codes, the patient is discharged from the ED and admitted for inpatient care, and the Admit/Encounter Reason is captured with a SNOMED CT code. Dates and times are provided in this test case to illustrate the sequence of clinical and messaging events. Since the exact dates and times are not reproducible when modeling the Test Case with a Health IT Module, only date and time format will be validated within tester submitted test data.",

  "testObjectives" : "This test case examines a Health IT Module's ability to create ADT A01-Admission message within the PHIN Messaging Guide's conformance requirements for syndromic surveillance.",
  "evaluationCriteria" : "No evaluation criteria",
  "notes" : "The OBX segment in the A01 message provides the originating visit type information through Facility/Visit Type. The admit described in the ED_Visit_Admit Test Scenario originated in the emergency department; therefore, \"Emergency Care\" is messaged in the OBX.5 element in the A01 message."
