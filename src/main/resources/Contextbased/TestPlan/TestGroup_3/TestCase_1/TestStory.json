  "teststorydesc" : "Syndromic surveillance is public health surveillance that emphasizes the use of near \"real-time\" health data and statistical tools for disease or hazardous event detection, situation awareness for mass gatherings and public health emergencies, and ad hoc and population health trend analyses. For syndromic surveillance purposes, required data on all clinical encounters must be sent to the jurisdictional public health agency within 24 hours of the start of any given encounter, and in accordance with local or state laws and practices.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe ED Visit with Admit Test Case provides an example of an ED visit for which the patient's chief complaint is captured as free-text, working diagnosis and final diagnosis are captured with SNOMED CT codes, the patient is discharged from the ED and admitted for inpatient care, and the Admit/Encounter Reason is captured with a SNOMED CT code.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn this test case, a disoriented, elderly male is brought to the emergency department on the day following a blizzard that caused power outages. He was nearly unconscious when found in his kitchen next to a gas oven. He states that he has a headache, nausea, and dizziness. The physician diagnoses him with carbon monoxide poisoning and orders him to be admitted as an inpatient for hyperbaric oxygen therapy. He is discharged from the ED and prepared for admission. Syndromic surveillance data about the visit are transmitted to the state health department.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThis test case involves 4 steps: a registration message (ADT^A04), an update message (ADT^A08), a discharge message (ADT^A03), and an admission message (ADT^A01).",
