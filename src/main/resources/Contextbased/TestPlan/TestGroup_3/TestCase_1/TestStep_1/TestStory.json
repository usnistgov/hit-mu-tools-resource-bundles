  "teststorydesc" : "<p>A disoriented 70 year-old male is brought by his neighbor to Southern Midwest Medical Center's Emergency Department at 7:30 AM on February 1, 2010, the day following a blizzard that caused power outages in many city neighborhoods. The patient is complaining of \"a headache, nausea, and dizziness\". The neighbor explains that he was concerned about the patient since the building's electric heating system was not working. At 7:00 AM, he entered the patient's apartment and found the patient nearly unconscious in the kitchen next to a fully lit gas oven and stove running at high. A clerical assistant registers the patient with the neighbor's help. She records the patient's name, date of birth, race, ethnicity, residence, insurance information, and health history. The clerical assistant also enters the patient's chief complaint as, \"A headache, nausea, and dizziness\". Southern Midwest Medical Center reports syndromic surveillance data to the state health department (SHD). At 7:45 AM on February 1, 2010, the hospital's electronic health record module for syndromic surveillance data assembles and transmits a Registration message about this encounter to CHD.</p>\r\n",
