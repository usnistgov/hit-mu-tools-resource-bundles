The patient is complaining of \"a headache, nausea, and dizziness\".\r\nThe neighbor explains that he was concerned about the patient since the\r\nbuilding's electric heating system was not working. At 7:00 AM, he entered the\r\npatient's apartment and found the patient unconscious in the kitchen next to a\r\nfully lit gas oven and stove running at high. A clerical assistant registers\r\nthe patient with the neighbor's help. She records the patient's name, date of\r\nbirth, race, ethnicity, residence, insurance information, and health history. The\r\nclerical assistant also enters the patient's chief complaint as, \"A headache,\r\nnausea, and dizziness\".

At 7:45 AM on February\r\n1, 2010, the hospital's electronic health record module for syndromic\r\nsurveillance data assembles and transmits a Registration message about this\r\nencounter to SHD.</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 10pt;\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n",
