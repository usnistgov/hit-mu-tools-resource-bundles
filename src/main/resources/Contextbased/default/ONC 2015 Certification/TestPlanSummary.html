<td colspan='2'><h3>Description</h3>Syndromic surveillance is public health surveillance that emphasizes the use of near "real-time" health data and statistical tools for disease or hazardous event detection, situation awareness for mass gatherings and public health emergencies, and ad hoc and population health trend analyses. For syndromic surveillance purposes, required data on all clinical encounters must be sent to the jurisdictional public health agency within 24 hours of any given encounter, and in accordance with local or state laws and practices.
<br>
The Child_Influenza Test Case provides an example of a clinical encounter that could take place in either an urgent care or emergency clinical setting. It is therefore applicable to EHR technology used in some ambulatory settings. This test case also provides an example where the facility sending the syndromic surveillance message is different than the facility where the patient received care.
<br>
In this test case, an infant is seen at an urgent care center for fever, cough, and earache. Diagnostic tests show that he has influenza and stenosis of the external ear canal. He is discharged to home with treatment instructions and a prescription. Syndromic surveillance data about the visit are transmitted to the local health department.
<br>
This test case involves 2 steps: a registration message (ADT^A04) followed by a discharge message (ADT^A03).<br/><h3>Test Objectives</h3>No Test Objectives

She records the patient`s name, date of birth, race, ethnicity, residence, insurance information, and health history. The clerical assistant also records the patient&#39;s chief complaint in free-text is, &quot;Fever, cough, and earache.&quot; At 8:35 AM a nurse sees the patient and performs a vital sign assessment, noting that the child currently has a temperature of 101.2 with a productive cough and right ear inflammation and fluid build-up. At 9:00 AM the physician orders a rapid influenza test, chest x-ray, and a treatment. The physician assigns the patient with working diagnoses of influenza with other respiratory manifestations (ICD-9 CM diagnosis code of 487.1), and stenosis of external ear canal due to inflammation (ICD-9 CM diagnosis code of 380.53) within the patient`s electronic medical record. Big City Children&#39;s Urgent Care is an outpatient facility operated by Children&#39;s Hospital of Big City that routinely sends electronic syndromic surveillance data to the Big City Health Department (BCHD) in accordance with a city regulation. At 10:00 AM on February 20, 2010, the facility`s electronic health record module for syndromic surveillance data assembles and transmits a Registration ADT message about this patient encounter.</p><br/><h3>Test Objectives</h3><p>This test step examines a Health IT Module&#39;s ability to create ADT^A04 Registration message within PHIN Messaging Guide&#39;s conformance requirements.</p><br/></td>

The tests indicate that the infant has influenza, and does not have pneumonia. The patient`s mother is provided with treatment information and prescriptions for her infant son. The working diagnoses (ICD-9 CM 487.1 and 380.53) are resolved/inactivated, and at 5 PM the patient is discharged home with final diagnoses of influenza and stenosis of external ear canal due to inflammation. Big City Children&#39;s Urgent Care is an outpatient facility operated by Children&#39;s Hospital of Big City that routinely sends electronic syndromic surveillance data to the Big City Health Department (BCHD) in accordance with a city regulation.
