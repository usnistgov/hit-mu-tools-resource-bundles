    <Description>Mrs Yolanda Vannatatu is a 84 year old Samoan woman, who goes in to her general practitioner for a general check-up on early in the morning on January 24, 2013 - she is a diabetic with hyperlipidema and hypertension. It has been a while since her last check-up. Dr. Jerry Lamaze orders a diabetic panel, that consists of Complete Metabolic Panel (CMP), a Complete Blood Count (CBC), Hemoglobin A1C, fasting glucose, Lipid Panel and a Urine Analysis (UA). Because Mrs Vannatatu is fasting and she is not good at following up Dr. Lamaze makes sure the blood and urine specimen are collected at his office and then sends it on to Century Hospital's  clinical laboratory the same day.&#13;
