		<Description>
		
Mr. William A. Jones is a 51 year old white male who presented with a history of high fever, fatigue, and shortness of breath on exertion. Dr. Nicholas Radon ordered a complete blood count (CBC) test to be performed. A blood specimen for the CBC test was collected from the patient and sent to the clinical lab at Century Hospital for processing. The order instructs that a copy of the test result report to be sent to Dr. Naddy Deluca.

Century Hospital's clinical laboratory receives the patient's specimen later the next day, but the specimen collection tubes are broken and the sample has leaked out. The laboratory staff enters this information into their system and an electronic Order Cancellation Notification message is sent to GoodHealth Clinic's EHR using the LOI message to cancel the test and state the reason for the cancellation.
