		<Description>Ms Hettie Nguyen is a 17 year old Asian-American female patient accompanied by her mother who presents to her pediatrician, Dr Ellen Yu for weakness, wt loss, and fatigue.    Dr Yu orders a Complete Metabolic Profile (CMP), a Comprehencive Blood Count ( CBC) and a TSH test from Century Hospital's clinical laboratory as part of her basic work up for her patient.  The laboratory tests are ordered through Dr Yu's EHR and the patient is instructed to visit the laboratory's patient service center the next day after fasting overnight.

The laboratory results are transmitted to Dr Yu's office the next day.  After reviewing the results and noting a borderline low TSH,  Dr Yu calls the lab to add a confirmatory Free T4 test to her earlier requisition.     She confims that this test can be performed on the same sample collected earlier that day.   Dr Yu's staff then confirms this order through the practice EHR-S by sending a confirmation to a verbal add-on order.</Description>
