		<Description>Maria Hernandez, a 24 year old African-American, Hispanic patient, is seen by her obstetrician Dr. John Feller at the Los Angeles Clinic where a point of service pregnancy test confirmed that Maria is pregnant. Because Maria has chronic hypertension, along with  the regular early pregnancy workup, Dr. Feller requests that Maria collect her urine for a 24 hour period and then return to the clinic the next day, so Dr. Feller can collect the required serum sample in for a Creatinine Clearance lab test request, which he forwards to the to the clinical lab at Century Hospital.  He also orders a 24 hour urine protein test.</Description>
