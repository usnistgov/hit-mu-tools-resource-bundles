		<Description>Mr. William A. Jones is a 51 year old white male who presented for a cardiology exam. Dr. Nicholas Radon ordered a lipid panel test to be performed to check for hyperlipidemia. A blood specimen for the lipid panel test was collected from the patient by Dr Radon's nurse and the order submitted electronically using the LOI message to the clinical lab at Century Hospital for processing. As part of the order submission, an ask-at-order-entry (AOE) question regarding the fasting status of the patient was answered "Yes" since Mr Jones had indeed fasted prior to the exam as previously instructed. Additionally, the order includes a request to send a copy of the test results to Dr. Pafford M. Hamlin, Sr.
