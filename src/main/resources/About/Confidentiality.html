		<p style="text-align: left;">In compliance with HIPAA
			Requirements, parties using the NIST HL7 V2 Validation Tools via this
			NIST Web site shall not use real data about living, identifiable
			individuals. Parties shall adhere to all Federal Regulations
			including, but not limited, to the Health Insurance Portability and
			Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Due to patient confidentiality
			issues (e.g., HIPAA requirements regarding PHI), this software should
			not be used via the NIST Web site for validation of messages
			containing real patient information. With proper precautions in place
			to maintain patient confidentiality, if an organization downloads the
			Validation Tool and uses it locally the Tool can validate messages
			with real patient information.</p>
